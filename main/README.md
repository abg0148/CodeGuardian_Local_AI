## What is CodeGuardian?
**CodeGuardian** is a real-time, on-device AI-powered tool designed for comprehensive code security. It eliminates the limitations of traditional cloud-based vulnerability scanners by providing a local, in-depth scan of your codebase. CodeGuardian identifies security vulnerabilities and offers actionable remediation suggestions directly within your development environment.

Built using LM Studio's on-device AI, CodeGuardian ensures developers get instant feedback on their code, reducing the time between vulnerability introduction and remediation. This approach is ideal for industries with stringent data security requirements, such as defense, healthcare, and critical infrastructure, where cloud solutions may not be viable.

Unlike cloud-based tools, CodeGuardian operates entirely offline, ensuring security and privacy by processing code locally on your device. Additionally, it periodically syncs with trusted vulnerability databases like CVE, NVD, and OWASP to update its threat models, ensuring that your code stays protected against emerging threats.

With its energy-efficient design, CodeGuardian is optimized for use on resource-constrained platforms, making it especially useful for mobile and IoT developers.
