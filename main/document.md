# Vulnerability Report for `test1.py`

## Vulnerability Analysis
a. Executive Summary
•	Overall risk assessment: High
•	Key findings summary: The provided Flask application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper handling of user input.

b. Vulnerability Details
•	Title: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
•	Summary: User-provided data is not properly sanitized before being echoed back in the response, allowing for script injection.
•	Severity: CVSS Base Score 7.5
•	Impact: An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the browser of any user viewing the page, potentially leading to session hijacking or other attacks.
•	Recommendations: Sanitize user input using a library like Flask-WTF or WTForms for form inputs, and ensure all data output is HTML-escaped.

# Vulnerability Report for `test2.cpp`

## Vulnerability Analysis
a. Executive Summary  
•	Overall risk assessment: High  
•	Key findings summary: The provided C++ code contains multiple critical vulnerabilities, primarily due to the use of `strcpy` without bounds checking and improper handling of dynamically allocated memory.

b. Vulnerability Details

1. **Title:** Buffer Overflow in `vulnerable_function`
   - **Summary:** The function `vulnerable_function` uses `strcpy` to copy a user-provided string into a fixed-size buffer, leading to a buffer overflow if the input exceeds 63 characters.
   - **Severity:** CVSS Base Score: 9.8 (High)
   - **Impact:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially compromising the system's security.
   - **Recommendations:** Use `strncpy` instead of `strcpy` and ensure that the destination buffer has enough space for the source string plus a null terminator. Additionally, always check the return value of `strncpy`.

2. **Title:** Use After Free in `main`
   - **Summary:** After freeing memory allocated with `malloc`, the code still attempts to use and print this freed memory using `strcpy`. This leads to undefined behavior.
   - **Severity:** CVSS Base Score: 8.5 (High)
   - **Impact:** The program might crash, leak sensitive information, or be exploited for other malicious activities.
   - **Recommendations:** Avoid accessing memory after it has been freed. Ensure that pointers are set to `nullptr` or `NULL` after freeing them to avoid accidental dereferencing.
